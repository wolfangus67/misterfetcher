**Pre-cache Stremio addon streams so every movie and show opens instantly - no more waiting for streams to load or for uncached streams to become available.**

## Why Use This?

### The Problem
When you browse Stremio and select a movie or series, there are often **two delays**:
1. **Addon delay**: Your addon searches for streams, processes them, and caches the results
2. **Stream source delay**: If streams are uncached on your streaming service, you have to wait for them to be converted/cached before playback

This happens every time you open something new or when caches expire. The combined wait can range from a few seconds to over a minute.

### The Solution
Streams Prefetcher **automatically pre-fetches streams** from your Stremio addons in the background, warming up caches **before** you even open Stremio. It works with both self-hosted and public addons.

**Two-layer caching:**
1. **Addon Cache**: Prefetches catalog data and stream information from your addons
2. **Stream Source Cache**: Automatically triggers your streaming service to cache uncached streams by sending requests to stream URLs

Think of it as preparing everything in advance - like preheating an oven before cooking.

### The Benefits
- **⚡ Instant Playback**: Click on any movie or series and streams appear immediately with no delays
- **🎯 Stream Source Coverage**: Ensure all your catalog items have streams **already cached** on your streaming service - no more waiting for "uncached" streams to convert
- **🔄 Automatic Stream Caching**: When streams are uncached (not playable yet), the tool automatically triggers your stream source to cache them
- **⏰ Set It and Forget It**: Schedule automatic prefetching (e.g., daily at 2 AM) to keep all caches warm 24/7
- **📊 Smart Control**: Choose which catalogs to prefetch, how many items, and fine-tune everything through an easy web interface
- **🌐 Works with Any Addon**: Compatible with both self-hosted addons and public addons

**Perfect for users who want their Stremio experience to feel instant and seamless, just like a native streaming service.**

> **💡 TIP:** While this tool works with public addons, frequent use against public addons increases their server load. Be considerate - use reasonable limits and schedules if prefetching from public addons. Self-hosted addons have no such concerns.

## Features

- **Intuitive Configuration**: User-friendly forms for all parameters
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Reorder addon URLs and catalogs with ease
- **Visual Progress Tracking**: See exactly what's happening in real-time
- **Job Control**: Start, stop, and schedule prefetch jobs
- **Multi-Addon Support**: Separate catalog and stream addons with flexible configuration
- **Time-Based Limits**: Set execution time limits and delays with human-readable formats (supports unlimited values)
- **Persistent State**: Jobs continue running even if you close the browser
- **Reset Functionality**: Clear configurations and log files with one click (preserves database)
- **Catalog Filtering**: Advanced filtering options for catalog selection
- **Log Management**: View, search, and delete log files directly from the UI

### Installation

#### Option 1: Using Pre-built Docker Images (Recommended)

1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file**:
   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'

   services:
     streams-prefetcher:
       image: registry.gitlab.com/deejay189393/streams-prefetcher:latest  # or :nightly for bleeding edge
       container_name: streams-prefetcher
       ports:
         - "5000:5000"
       volumes:
         - ./data:/app/data
       environment:
         - TZ=America/New_York  # Your timezone
         - LOG_LEVEL=INFO
       restart: unless-stopped
   ```

2. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access the web interface**:
   - `http://your-server-ip:5000`

#### Option 2: Build from Source

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/deejay189393/streams-prefetcher.git
   cd streams-prefetcher
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables** (optional):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env to set your configuration
   ```

3. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

4. **Access the web interface**:
   - Direct access: `http://your-server-ip:5000`
   - With domain: Configure your reverse proxy (see below)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`) to customize:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `STREAMS_PREFETCHER_HOSTNAME` | Required for Traefik | Hostname for reverse proxy routing |
| `DOCKER_DATA_DIR` | Required | Directory for persistent data storage |
| `PORT` | 5000 | Port the application runs on |
| `TZ` | UTC | Timezone for logs and scheduled jobs |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | INFO | Logging verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) |

**Example `.env`:**
```bash
STREAMS_PREFETCHER_HOSTNAME=streams-prefetcher.yourdomain.com
DOCKER_DATA_DIR=/opt/docker-data
PORT=5000
TZ=America/New_York
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Reverse Proxy Configuration (Nginx)

If you're using Nginx as a reverse proxy:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name streams-prefetcher.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # For Server-Sent Events (SSE)
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_cache off;
        proxy_set_header Connection '';
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        chunked_transfer_encoding off;
    }
}
```

### Reverse Proxy Configuration (Traefik)

The labels in `compose.yaml` already include Traefik configuration. Ensure you set the `STREAMS_PREFETCHER_HOSTNAME` environment variable:

```yaml
labels:
  - "traefik.enable=true"
  - "traefik.http.routers.streams-prefetcher.rule=Host(`${STREAMS_PREFETCHER_HOSTNAME?}`)"
  - "traefik.http.routers.streams-prefetcher.entrypoints=websecure"
  - "traefik.http.routers.streams-prefetcher.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
  - "traefik.http.routers.streams-prefetcher.middlewares=authelia@docker"
```

**Note:** The Authelia middleware is included for authentication. Remove this line if you're not using Authelia.

## User Guide

### 1. Configuration

#### Addon URLs
Configure your addon URLs in three categories:
- **Both**: Addons used for both catalog and stream endpoints
- **Catalog Only**: Addons used only to fetch catalog data
- **Stream Only**: Addons used only to prefetch streams

**Features**:
- Add unlimited addon URLs
- Drag and drop URLs between categories
- Reorder URLs within categories
- Automatic manifest fetching and validation
- Smart URL normalization (automatically strips Stremio endpoints)

**Supported URL Formats**:

The system automatically normalizes addon URLs by stripping common Stremio addon endpoints. You can paste URLs in any of these formats:

- Base addon URL: `https://addon.example.com/stremio/v1`
- With `/manifest.json`: `https://addon.example.com/stremio/v1/manifest.json`
- With `/configure`: `https://addon.example.com/stremio/v1/configure`
- With resource endpoints: `https://addon.example.com/stremio/v1/catalog/movie/top`

All formats above will be normalized to the base URL (`https://addon.example.com/stremio/v1`) automatically.

**Examples**:
```
https://aiostreams.example.com/stremio/some-text-here
https://aiostreams.example.com/stremio/some-text-here/configure
https://aiostreams.example.com/stremio/some-text-here/manifest.json
https://myaddon.example.com/v1/stream/movie/tt1234567
```

#### Limits
Set global and per-catalog limits:
- **Movies Global Limit**: Total movies to prefetch across all catalogs (-1 for unlimited)
- **Series Global Limit**: Total series to prefetch across all catalogs (-1 for unlimited)
- **Movies per Catalog**: Max movies from each movie catalog (-1 for unlimited)
- **Series per Catalog**: Max series from each series catalog (-1 for unlimited)
- **Items per Mixed Catalog**: Max items from catalogs with both movies and series (-1 for unlimited)

#### Time-Based Parameters
- **Delay Between Requests**: Delay between each stream request (prevent rate limiting). Can be set to 0 for no delay
- **Cache Validity**: How long to consider cached items valid. Set to -1 for unlimited (never expire)
- **Max Execution Time**: Maximum time for a prefetch run. Set to -1 for unlimited

Format: Enter a number and select the unit (milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks). All time-based parameters support unlimited values (-1)

#### Stream Source Cache Requests
Request uncached streams to be cached by sending HTTP requests to their URLs (disabled by default):
- **Enable Cache Requests**: Toggle to enable/disable the entire feature (default: OFF)
- **Global Cache Request Limit**: Maximum total cache requests per prefetch session (-1 for unlimited, default: 50)
- **Per-Item Cache Request Limit**: Maximum cache requests per movie/series/episode (-1 for unlimited, default: 1)
- **Cached Streams Count Threshold**: Maximum number of already-cached streams allowed before triggering cache requests (default: 0)
  - Setting to 0 means cache requests only trigger when NO cached streams exist (recommended)
  - Higher values allow cache requests even when some cached streams are available

**How it works**:
1. System detects cached vs uncached streams using regex pattern matching
2. If cached stream count is below threshold, system requests uncached streams to be cached
3. Sends HTTP requests to uncached stream URLs, signaling the service to cache them
4. Tracks success/failure rates and displays comprehensive statistics

**Statistics tracked**:
- Total cache requests sent
- Successful vs failed cache requests (HTTP 2xx = success)
- Success rate percentages shown in real-time
- Per-catalog cache request breakdowns in completion screen

#### Advanced Options
- **HTTP Proxy**: Route requests through a proxy (optional)
- **Randomize Catalog Processing**: Process catalogs in random order
- **Randomize Item Prefetching**: Process items within catalogs in random order
- **Enable Logging**: Save detailed logs to `data/logs/` directory

#### Reset Configuration
- **Reset to Defaults**: Click the reset button to restore all settings to default values
- **What Gets Cleared**:
  - All configuration settings (addon URLs, limits, time parameters, etc.)
  - All log files
  - Addon name cache
  - Active schedules
- **What's Preserved**:
  - Prefetch cache database (streams_prefetcher_prefetch_cache.db)
  - Data directory structure

**Note**: Reset is irreversible. The prefetch cache database is intentionally preserved as it contains valuable cached stream data.

### 2. Catalog Selection

## Troubleshooting

### Container Won't Start

Check logs:
```bash
docker compose logs streams-prefetcher
```

Ensure port 5000 is available:
```bash
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 5000
```

### Can't Access Web Interface

1. Check container is running: `docker ps`
2. Verify firewall allows port 5000
3. Check reverse proxy configuration
4. Review nginx/traefik logs

### Job Fails to Start

1. Verify addon URLs are accessible
2. Check addon URLs have correct format
3. Ensure at least one addon URL is configured
4. Review logs in `data/logs/` (if logging is enabled)

### Real-Time Updates Not Working

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify SSE connection in Network tab
3. Ensure reverse proxy allows SSE (no buffering)
4. Try refreshing the page

### Configuration Not Saving

1. Check `data/config/` directory permissions
2. Ensure disk space is available
3. Review container logs for errors
4. Verify JSON format in `config.json`

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Limits

Adjust in `compose.yaml`:
```yaml
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpus: '2'
      memory: 1G
    reservations:
      cpus: '0.5'
      memory: 256M
```

### Worker Configuration

For high-concurrency, edit Dockerfile CMD:
```dockerfile
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "--workers", "4", "--threads", "8", ...]
```

### Delay Configuration

For rate-limited addons:
- Increase delay between requests
- Use randomization to spread load
- Consider running during off-peak hours

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

Since this version doesn't include built-in authentication, protect access using:

1. **Reverse Proxy Authentication** (Nginx):
   ```nginx
   auth_basic "Restricted Access";
   auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
   ```

2. **Authelia** (recommended for advanced use):
   - Integrates with Traefik/Nginx
   - Provides 2FA, SSO, and access policies
   - Already configured in compose.yaml Traefik labels

3. **VPN/Tailscale**:
   - Access only via private network
   - No public exposure

4. **Firewall Rules**:
   - Restrict access to specific IPs
   - Use fail2ban for brute force protection

### HTTPS

Always use HTTPS in production:
- Configure Let's Encrypt with Traefik
- Use Certbot with Nginx
- Terminate SSL at reverse proxy level

## Upgrading

### Updating Streams Prefetcher

```bash
git pull origin main
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

Your data in the `data/` directory will be preserved. Configuration and catalog selections will remain intact.
