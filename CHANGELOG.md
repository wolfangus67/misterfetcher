## [0.13.1] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed
- Pause functionality now works correctly when processing cached or failed items
- Cancel button now responds immediately when job is paused (previously hung indefinitely)
- Episode counts and statistics now display correctly on completion screen when jobs are canceled or interrupted (previously showed 0)
- Partial results are properly captured and displayed when canceling paused jobs

### Changed
- Refactored statistics finalization into centralized methods for improved code maintainability
- Simplified statistics population logic across all exit paths (normal, interrupted, exception)

## [0.13.0] - 2025-10-17

### Added
- Comprehensive error diagnostics on failure screen with full Python tracebacks, error type display, and configuration snapshot
- Copy button to export all error details for easy troubleshooting and issue reporting
- Health check log filtering to reduce log noise (silences 2880 daily health check entries)
- Dual logging format support (text/json) for centralized logging systems via LOG_FORMAT environment variable
- Detailed DEBUG-level logging for HTTP operations, cache hits/misses, and database operations

### Changed
- Enhanced logger with colored output (green INFO, cyan DEBUG) for easier log scanning
- Improved error screen with collapsible technical details section
- Proper log level implementation across all modules (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)

## [0.12.8] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed
- Excessive debug logging causing log files to balloon to 75MB
  - Removed AUTO_REDRAW_DEBUG log statements (7 locations in streams_prefetcher.py)
  - Removed PROGRESS_CALLBACK_DEBUG log statement (streams_prefetcher_wrapper.py)
  - Debug statements were logging 2-3 lines per item processed (315K items = 945K log lines)
  - Log files now ~5-10KB instead of 75MB (99.99% reduction)
  - All important information retained (config, catalogs, timing, summary)

## [0.12.7] - 2025-10-17

### Fixed
- Poster crossfade animation during fast prefetching
  - Implemented dual poster system with simultaneous crossfading
  - Eliminates lag when items are cached and process rapidly (100-200ms intervals)
  - New posters load invisibly in background while current poster remains visible
  - Smooth 800ms transition between posters handles both rapid and slow processing speeds
- Catalog filtering now properly distinguishes between movie and series catalogs with same manifest ID
  - Uses composite key (addon_url|catalog_id|catalog_type) for accurate filtering
  - Prevents catalog selection conflicts when addons have identically named movie/series catalogs
- UI button resizing during countdown animations
  - Added flex-shrink prevention to maintain consistent button sizes
  - Buttons no longer change size during long-press countdown operations
- Poster hiding issues during rapid prefetching
  - Improved poster visibility logic to prevent premature hiding
  - Better handling of rapid item transitions

### Changed
- Increased poster crossfade duration from 500ms to 800ms for more cinematic transition

  - Nightly builds run daily at 3 AM EST

## [0.12.5] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- Web UI failing to load after rapid page refreshes (3+ times in quick succession)
  - Root cause: SSE connection accumulation exhausting Gunicorn thread pool
  - Added beforeunload handler to explicitly close SSE connections on page unload
  - Reduced SSE queue timeout from 30s to 10s for faster stale connection cleanup
  - Proactive cleanup of dead queues when broadcast fails
  - Increased Gunicorn thread pool from 4 to 8 threads for better concurrency
  - Successfully tested with 8+ rapid refreshes

### Changed
- Updated terminology from "Service" to "Stream Source" throughout UI
  - More accurately reflects that feature works with generic stream sources, not just debrid services
  - Updated section headings, tooltips, and documentation

Closes #30

## [0.12.4] - 2025-10-15

### Changed
- Centralized catalog ID management with dedicated utility modules
  - Created `src/catalog_id_utils.py` with 5 utility functions for Python backend
  - Created `web/js/catalog_id_utils.js` with matching functions for JavaScript frontend
  - All catalog ID creation and parsing now uses utility functions instead of inline string operations
  - Catalog ID format explicitly documented: `addon_url|catalog_id|catalog_type`

### Fixed
- Prevents future catalog selection parsing bugs by standardizing ID handling across backend and frontend
  - Single source of truth for ID format in each language
  - Self-documenting code with comprehensive docstrings and JSDoc comments
  - Easy to modify format in future (update one place, not scattered across files)

## [0.12.3] - 2025-10-14

### Added
- Skip Streams Containing (RegEx) configuration option to filter out non-stream items before classifying as cached/uncached
  - Useful for filtering informative cards (e.g., from Ratings addon) that aren't actual streams
  - Skipped streams don't count as cached or uncached, preventing unnecessary cache requests
  - Defaults to blank (no skipping) for backward compatibility
  - Added UI input field with descriptive tooltip

Closes #31

## [0.12.2] - 2025-10-14

### Fixed
- Fixed catalog selection persistence bug for catalogs sharing the same manifest ID
  - Catalogs with same manifest ID but different types (e.g., "New" movie vs "New" series) were overwriting each other
  - Backend now includes catalog type in ID generation to ensure uniqueness: `{addon_url}|{manifest_id}|{type}`
  - Removed unnecessary composite key workaround from frontend since IDs are now unique from backend
  - All catalogs now have guaranteed unique IDs preventing selection state conflicts

**Note:** Users will need to reload their catalogs in the UI as old saved selections use the previous ID format.

## [0.12.1] - 2025-10-14

### Fixed
- Catalog selections not persisting after page refresh
  - Fixed merge logic using composite key (id|type) instead of just id to properly handle catalogs with duplicate IDs
  - Prevents catalog overwrites when addons return same ID for movies and series (e.g., "New" movies and "New" series)
  - Fixed auto-save triggering on silent page loads, which was overwriting saved selections
  - Added extensive debug logging for catalog save/load operations in both frontend and backend

Closes #27

### Fixed
- SQLite threading error on ARM64 that prevented prefetch jobs from running
- `sqlite3.ProgrammingError: SQLite objects created in a thread can only be used in that same thread`

Closes #25

## [0.10.1] - 2025-10-07

### Fixed
